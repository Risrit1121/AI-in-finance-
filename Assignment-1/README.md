Scaling‑Law DC Strategy + Another Intraday Strategy
 Trading Strategies for cTrader
 
This repository contains the C# source code for two algorithmic trading strategies developed for the cTrader platform. The primary focus is an advanced AI-enhanced Directional Change (DC) strategy, which is benchmarked against a classic Simple Moving Average (SMA) Crossover strategy with an ADX filter.

The project includes a detailed ablation study to quantify the impact of specific AI components on the DC strategy's performance, comparing it against both its baseline version and the SMA benchmark.

Strategies Implemented
1. AI-Enhanced Directional Change (DC) Strategy
This is a sophisticated, tick-based strategy designed to capture market trends with high precision. It is built upon the concept of Directional Change, which defines trends based on price movements of a specific magnitude rather than fixed time intervals.

Core Logic: Identifies trend continuations and reversals based on price action exceeding a predefined threshold.

AI Enhancement 1: Market Regime Filter: A volatility-based filter that classifies the market as either "Trending" or "Ranging." The bot pauses trading during unfavorable (ranging) conditions to avoid false signals.

AI Enhancement 2: Multi-Factor Entry Classifier: An entry quality model that analyzes multiple market factors to approve or reject trading signals generated by the core DC logic, aiming to improve the win rate.

Exit Mechanism: Employs a "Scaling-Law Exit Strategy" for dynamic and optimized take-profit levels.

2. SMA Crossover Strategy with ADX Filter
This strategy serves as a performance benchmark. It is a classic, time-based intraday strategy implemented on an hourly timeframe that uses the Average Directional Index (ADX) to filter for trending markets.

Entry Signal (Golden Cross): A long position is opened when the short-term SMA (e.g., 20-period) crosses above the long-term SMA (e.g., 50-period), but only if the ADX value is above a certain threshold (e.g., 25), indicating a strong trend.

Exit Signal (Death Cross): The position is closed when the short-term SMA crosses below the long-term SMA.

Ablation Study & Performance
An ablation study was conducted on the DC strategy to isolate and measure the contribution of each AI component. The following versions were backtested and compared.
